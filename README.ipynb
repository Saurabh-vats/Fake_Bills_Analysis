    "# Bill Genuineness Check Using KNN Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to check the genuineness of bills using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The dataset used in this project contains various features of bills, and the goal is to classify them as genuine or fake based on these features. Hyperparameter tuning techniques were employed to find the optimal parameters for the KNN model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset `fake_bills.csv` contains the following columns:\n",
    "- `diagonal`: Diagonal length of the bill\n",
    "- `height_left`: Height of the left side of the bill\n",
    "- `height_right`: Height of the right side of the bill\n",
    "- `margin_low`: Lower margin of the bill\n",
    "- `margin_up`: Upper margin of the bill\n",
    "- `length`: Length of the bill\n",
    "- `class`: Label indicating whether the bill is genuine (1) or fake (0)\n",

    "\n",
    "## Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis was conducted using the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preprocessing**: \n",
    "   - Load the dataset and perform basic cleaning.\n",
    "   - Split the data into training and testing sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Scaling**:\n",
    "   - Standardize the features to ensure they have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Building**:\n",
    "   - Build a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier.\n",
    "   - Use cross-validation to evaluate the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:\n",
    "   - Use GridSearchCV to find the optimal number of neighbors (`n_neighbors`) and other hyperparameters for the KNN model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Model Evaluation**:\n",
    "   - Evaluate the model performance on the test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The key findings from the analysis are as follows:\n",
    "- The optimal hyperparameters for the KNN model were determined using GridSearchCV.\n",
    "- The final KNN model achieved high accuracy in classifying genuine and fake bills.\n",
    "- (   Accuracy :  0.9566666666666667\n",

    "## How to Use\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dependencies**: Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:\n",
    "   - pandas\n",
    "   - numpy\n",
    "   - matplotlib\n",
    "   - seaborn\n",
    "   - scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Running the Analysis**:\n",
    "   - Load the dataset using pandas: `df = pd.read_csv('fake_bills.csv')`\n",
    "   - Follow the steps in the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script to perform the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:\n",
    "   - Use GridSearchCV to find the optimal hyperparameters for the KNN model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates the use of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm and hyperparameter tuning techniques to classify the genuineness of bills. The model achieved high accuracy and can be used as a tool to assist in identifying fake bills.\n",
